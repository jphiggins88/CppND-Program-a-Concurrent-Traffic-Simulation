// Before generating build, building, and running, you may need to build and install opencv.
// See below for opencv setup.

mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./traffic_simulation



// Installing Open CV locally

// First install dev packages for GUI support BEFORE installing opencv.
sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config

// Donwload the latest OpenCV snapshot to your downloads folder
wget -O opencv.zip https://github.com/opencv/opencv/archive/4.x.zip

// Unzip
unzip opencv.zip

// Rename to opencv
mv opencv-4.x opencv

// Create a temporary build folder in downloads
mkdir -p build && cd build

// Generate build setup with cmake and targer the recently unzipped opencv directory
cmake ../opencv

// Run make with as many cores as possible. This will take a while to build
make -j4

// Install open CV to your system
// By default it will be installed to /usr/local
// Don't forget this part. It is needed for cmake to be able to recognize opencv dependencies from your main project.
sudo make install

// Delete the temporary build directory and the downloaded zip and extracted directory.
// You don't need the source files or intermediate files since all necessary .bin and library files have been copied over to /usr/local for system-wide use.
rm -rf opencv
rm -rf build
